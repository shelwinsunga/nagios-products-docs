## Windows SSH

**Windows SSH** is a configuration wizard in Nagios XI that is meant to be a replacement for the deprecated WMI wizard. It's designed to monitor a Windows machine remotely, meaning that you don't need to install any scripts or plugins on the remote.

### Setup

<Steps>
### Generating an SSH key
We're going to need to set up SSH such that we can connect to the remote machine without a password (you can skip this step if you already have a Windows machine you can passwordlessly SSH into). You need to have Nagios XI installed and a Windows machine to monitor.

- From your Nagios XI system, make sure you're a nagios user by casting `su nagios` onto the terminal.

- Now we need to generate an SSH key. I don't really care what key you use, but for the purposes of this tutorial I'm using an `ed25519` key. They're short, like me (5'6).

  - `ssh-keygen -t ed25519`

Trust the computer, say yes to the prompts. It should save a key in somewhere like `/home/nagios/.ssh/`

### Installing OpenSSH on Windows

Now switch to your Windows machine. This is the hard part, or at least it was for me. I'll try to make it easy for you.

- Open up powershell as an administrator. We need to install OpenSSH, so just trust me and run this:
  - `Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0`
  - `Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0`

We can see if it's installed by running `Get-WindowsCapability -Online | Where-Object Name -like 'OpenSSH*'`.

You should get output like this:

```
    Name  : OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0
    State : Installed

    Name  : OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0
    State : Installed
```

You're going to trust me again and run this:

```powershell
Restart-Service sshd

# Sets the service to start automatically
Set-Service -Name sshd -StartupType 'Automatic'

# Creates a firewall exception for OpenSSH
if (!(Get-NetFirewallRule -Name "OpenSSH-Server-In-TCP" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object Name, Enabled)) {
    Write-Output "Firewall Rule 'OpenSSH-Server-In-TCP' does not exist, creating it..."
    New-NetFirewallRule -Name 'OpenSSH-Server-In-TCP' -DisplayName 'OpenSSH Server (sshd)' -Enabled True -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -Action Allow -LocalPort 22
} else {
    Write-Output "Firewall rule 'OpenSSH-Server-In-TCP' has been created and exists."
}

# Makes Powershell the default shell
New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\OpenSSH" -Name DefaultShell -Value "C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" -PropertyType String -Force

```

### Configuring SSH keys on Windows

Create the `C:\ProgramData\ssh\administrators_authorized_keys` file

- `New-Item -Path "C:\ProgramData\ssh\administrators_authorized_keys" -ItemType File`

Open the file in notepad

- `notepad C:\ProgramData\ssh\administrators_authorized_keys`

Go back into your Nagios XI machine and copy the SSH key you generated

- `cat /home/nagios/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` to see it in the terminal
  Somehow, someway, get it into the `administrators_authorized_keys` file on the Windows machine

After saving the file, open it up in file explorer and make sure it's not a `.txt` file. If it is, go to **Views** &rarr; **Options** &rarr; and find the **Hide extensions for known file types** option. Make it so that you can see the extension and rename it to `administrators_authorized_keys` (no .txt).

Now, in the file explorer, right click on `administrators_authorized_keys` and click **Properties** &rarr; **Security** &rarr; **Advanced** &rarr; **Change Permissions** &rarr; **Disable Inheritance** &rarr; \*\*Remove all inherited permissions from this object\*\*.

After that, click **Add** in the same menu and you should see **Select a principal**, which, you guessed it, you should click. The object name you need to input is the username of the Windows user. If you don't know it, go to **Task manager** &rarr; **Users** and you should see it there.

After adding the user, check all the permission boxes (except for **Special**). Click **OK** and then **Apply**. Repeat this for SYSTEM. You should have two users with all permissions.

Now, go back to the terminal on your Nagios XI machine and try to SSH into the Windows machine. It should ask you for a fingerprint at first. If everything is in order, you can now passwordlessly SSH into the Windows machine.

### Getting the Windows SSH wizard

On the Nagios XI system, open the terminal and do a `git clone git@git.nagios.com:ssunga/windows-ssh.git`.

Zip the file with `zip -r windows-ssh.zip windows-ssh "*.git*"`

Now, on the XI user interface, go to **Admin** &rarr; **System Extensions** &rarr; **Config Wizards**.

Upload the zip file and install it. You should see a new wizard called **Windows SSH**.

</Steps>
You're all good to go!
