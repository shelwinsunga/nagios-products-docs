# Installation Prerequisites

## Overview

**Important:** Nagios Enterprises highly recommends and will only support installing Nagios XI on a newly installed, "clean" system (a bare minimal install with nothing else installed or configured).

Nagios XI is currently supported with the following Linux distributions for 64 bit installations only:

- RHEL 7/8/9
- CentOS 7
- CentOS Stream 8/9
- Oracle Linux 7/8
- Debian 9/10/11
- Ubuntu 16/18/20/22 (LTS)

Attempting to install Nagios XI on a pre-existing system with other applications already installed can cause the Nagios XI installation process to fail, critical system components and settings (e.g. database servers) to be modified in a way that negatively affects other applications, and previously installed applications to be automatically upgraded or removed. While installing XI on a system with other applications is possible, it is not recommended due to the possible interactions and complexity of multiple components that are required for Nagios XI to function. If you choose to ignore these warnings, you do so at your own risk.

Internet access is required for installation and upgrades!
