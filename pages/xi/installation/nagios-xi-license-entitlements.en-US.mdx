## Nagios XI License Entitlements

Every Nagios XI License key is valid for 3 installs, each with their own specific purpose. Each install is necessary to properly manage and maintain a fully functional monitoring implementation. The following install descriptions are listed below:  
  

1.  **Production Install** - The main monitoring install for a given license key. This is the install that system administrators use on their production servers and infrastructure to monitor their environment and receive notifications when systems are not working properly.

2.  **Test/Lab Environment** - The second install is for use in a test environment. This ensures that when upgrades are necessary, or major configuration changes are implemented, there are not adverse effects to the main monitoring system. The test install allows teams to “preview” their changes without jeopardizing the main system.

3.  **Backup Install** - Each Nagios XI license key may be used on one separate monitoring server that is designated as a disaster recovery (DR) instance, as long as the following condition is met:

    - The DR instance is in non-operational mode (e.g. it is not actively monitoring hosts and services), except when it assumes operation when the primary monitoring server fails.

  
These use cases, when implemented correctly, provide organizations with an infrastructure monitoring system capable of handling any environment.

**Note** : Deviation from the above use cases is a violation of Nagios license terms and conditions. For more information, contact sales@nagios.com .

### License Expiration

When your license expires, the Nagios XI Standard Edition will continue working, however the Enterprise features (if you had Enterprise) will no longer work. You wouldn't be able to upgrade your Nagios XI server or to migrate to a new server.

Also, you won't have support, with the exception of the Nagios XI General Support forum. If you want to, you can renew maintenance only or maintenance and support.
