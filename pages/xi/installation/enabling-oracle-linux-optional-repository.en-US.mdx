# Enabling Oracle Linux Optional Repository

## Problem Description

When you attempt to install or upgrade one of the Nagios products you receive the following error:

```
ERROR: Please enable the 'Optional' repo for your system in:
```

## Resolving The Problem

You need to add the Optional repository so that Nagios XI can install the necessary prerequisites using the commands below:

```
yum install -y yum-utils

yum-config-manager --enable ol7_optional_latest
```

That's it! You should be able to run the installer again and complete your installation.
