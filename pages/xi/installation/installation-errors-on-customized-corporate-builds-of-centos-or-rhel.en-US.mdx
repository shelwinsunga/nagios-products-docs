# Installation errors on customized corporate builds of CentOS or RHEL

## Overview

In larger enterprises, a "standard build" of CentOS or RHEL is required based on internal policies. These often differ from a clean minimal install of the OS as per our requirements.

Depending on the policies implemented in the build process, the Nagios application may not be able to successfully install.

Examples of known problems:

- There have been modification to the umask on the machine
- nagios or other user account is not allowed to be used
- nagios or other user account is created ahead of the installation
- sudoers file is overwritten periodically by automated processes

## Explanation

In such circumstances we can assist in identifying the problem to get the product working in your environment however from this point on support will be limited due to the customizations.
