# Backend API

## Backend API

The original backend API for Nagios XI was designed to query current status and historical information.

[Documentation - Backend API Access](https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagiosxi/docs/Accessing_The_XI_Backend_API.pdf "Backend API Access")

## Backend REST API

As of Nagios XI 5, a new REST API was introduced. This API allows you to read, write, delete, and update data in the Nagios XI system through commands that are authenticated via Nagios XI API keys.

All of the documentation is available inside of the Nagios XI product via the **Help** menu. In the left pane you will find the section **REST API Docs** .
