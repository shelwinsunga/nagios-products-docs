Monitoring a single, connected network is straightforward. When you need to monitor various locations, with different access and connectivity challenges, things get a little more complicated. This talk will cover the various methods that can be used to monitor hosts and services in remote locations, whether or not they are under your direct control, using techniques and tools such as SSH Tunnels, NRPE, NRDP, and reflection. This talk will cover both generic approaches for remote monitoring, and how these methods are implemented in the MonBOX Remote Monitoring Appliance.
