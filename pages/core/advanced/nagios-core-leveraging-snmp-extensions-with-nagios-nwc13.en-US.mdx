## Leveraging SNMP Extensions with Nagios - NWC13

The MIB for SNMP extension is NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB which can be used as an agent-less option for monitoring. This MIB will provide the option to query commands or shell scripts for metrics that are created from the scripts. Basically what this allows is that SNMP can be used to execute any scripts on the remote host to use for monitoring and replace other options like NRPE which require an agent. Practical examples on how to use extend scripts for Nagios monitoring and for event handlers will be shown in the session.
