## Nagios on AWS - Live Install and More! - NWC14

In this session, we will start with a brand new Amazon Web Service EC2 virtual instance install of Nagios Core, do some basic configuration and security hardening, install check_mk, and then have it monitor something. All right there, live, at the conference. New this year, we will also show how to expand this to additional servers automatically through AWS APIs.
