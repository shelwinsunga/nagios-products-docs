## TCP Wrapper Integration

This document explains how to easily generate alerts in Nagios for connection attempts that are rejected by TCP wrappers. For example, if an unauthorized host attempts to connect to your SSH server, you can receive an alert in Nagios that contains the name of the host that was rejected. If you implement this on your Linux/Unix boxes, you'll be surprised how many port scans you can detect across your network.
