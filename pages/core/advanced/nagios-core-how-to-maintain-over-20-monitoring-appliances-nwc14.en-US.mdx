## How to Maintain Over 20 Monitoring Appliances - NWC14

This presentation will give the answer to issues we've faced in managing multiple Nagios server deployments. We have about 25 engineers using the Nagios servers located at our customers premises and he servers are not allowed to connect back to our office, so there is no central user database. The presentation will cover how to install, maintain and develop in an environment with over 20 Nagios servers, what our environment looks like, and the advantages and disadvantages of our implementation.
