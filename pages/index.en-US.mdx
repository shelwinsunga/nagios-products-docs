This is a prototype for the new Nagios documentation site. It is built with [Nextra](https://nextra.site) and  [Next.js](nextjs.org).


## Overview

I scraped the public facing Knowledge base with `pandoc` and `beautifulsoup` and converted it to markdown. 

We start by finding all the links to the articles on the main page. Then we loop through each link and scrape the article. 


```python 
 def get_articles():
        # get the main page of the knowledge base
        r = requests.get(base_url)
        soup = BeautifulSoup(r.content, 'html.parser')
        # get the href from the anchor tag inside the div and push it to a link array
        # include base url in links
        links = [link.find('a').get('href') for link in soup.find_all('div', class_='article')]
        return links
```

Next, we get the title of the article and the content.


```python
def save_markdown(links):
        for link in links:
            r = requests.get(link)
            soup = BeautifulSoup(r.content, 'html.parser')
            title = soup.select('.article-title')[0].get_text()
            content = soup.find("div", {"id": "ARTICLECONTENT"}).find("article").prettify()
```

And after a ton of formatting, we get the markdown files. 

```python
content = pypandoc.convert_text(content, 'md', format='html', extra_args=['-t', 'gfm-raw_html', '--wrap=none'])
content = format_markdown(content)
content = f'---\ntitle: "{title}"\nfull: true\n---\n\n# {title}\n\n{content}'
with open(f'md/{Filetitle}.md', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
  f.write(content)
```

## Features

Here's the improvements from the original KB
- **Fast** and **lightweight**
- **Real-time** experience
- SSG, SSR, and ISR support
- Blazing fast full text search
- **Dark mode** support
- Advanced syntax highlighting with [Shiki](https://shiki.matsu.io/)
- Hybrid rendering, next generation 

Some things that still need fixing:
- Need to scrape more of the KB
- Need to fix any formatting errors
- Broken links
- Image generation
- Etc
